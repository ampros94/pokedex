# pokedex
1- First I comment out the existing code in the js file to start a new one. 

2- I create a constant to bring me the card container and create a variable for the API link, I create a cycle to bring me the first 150 prokemon in the list.

3- I make a variable where I will concatenate the text fields I have with the ones I get from the API. 

4- I make a constant where I create the HTML card in JS and where I start to concatenate the fields with the ones I get from the API
